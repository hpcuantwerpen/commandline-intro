# Command line tools

This is a short reference document explaining basic usage of some
common UNIX command line tools.  It can serve as a companion in an
introductory course.

## Layout

The document uses the corporate design/layout guidelines proposed by
VSC (in turn derived from the [Flemish government guidelines](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/communicatie/huisstijl)).

## Requirements

The source text is formatted for ConTeXt mkiv.  In order to generate a
document, you need a working ConTeXt installation, a recent (2019 or
later) version of the Flanders Art fonts, and the inconsolata font.

The fonts and layout are defined in the 'environment' files
env_vscstyle.tex and env_vscfonts.tex.  You can use them in other
documents to obtain the same layout.
